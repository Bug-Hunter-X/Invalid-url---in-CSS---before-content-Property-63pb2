The following CSS rule uses an invalid value for the `content` property in the `::before` pseudo-element:

```css
.element::before {
  content: url(invalid-path.jpg);
}
```

The `url()` function in the `content` property is only valid for referencing images within the `background-image` property, not the `content` property itself.  Attempting to use it will often result in no visible effect. To display an image, you'd typically use a background image on the element itself.
